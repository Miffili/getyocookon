# Get yo' cook on â€¢ A React.js web app

This is going to be my second project with React.js. Project start: April 17, 2018

## The plan

After coding the [Chuck-o-mat](https://github.com/Miffili/ChuckyN), I wanted to up my game a bit. With this app, I want to:

* deepen my knowledge of coding in React.js
* connect a database, and possibly `local storage`
* implement the possibility for a user to register and/or login
* implement CRUD

For this app, I further decided to use ~~[React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), which currently targets Bootstrap v3~~ [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/).

Additionally I will [log](log.md) my process as comprehensible as possible, starting in May (redesign).

## User stories

The user can:

* [ ] see a collection of recipes
* [ ] each recipe card provides a picture & a few details
* [ ] get more information about recipe either by clicking on the card or a button
* [ ] filter recipes
* [ ] sort recipes by different parameters

More advanced features will include:

* [ ] setting up account & logging into that account
* [ ] adding & deleting recipes to own collection/cook book
* [ ] adding, editing & deleting own recipe
* [ ] rating recipes
