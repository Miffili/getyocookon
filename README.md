# Get yo' cook on â€¢ A React.js web app

This is going to be my second project with React.js.  

## The plan

After coding the [Chuck-o-mat](https://github.com/Miffili/ChuckyN), I wanted to up my game a bit. With this app, I want to:  
* deepen my knowledge of coding in React.js  
* connect a database, and possibly `local storage`  
* implement the possibility for a user to register and/or login  
* implement CRUD

For this app, I further decided to use [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), which currently targets Bootstrap v3.  

Additionally I will [log](log.md) my process, as comprehensible as possible.

## User stories

The user can:  
- [ ] see a collection of recipes  
- [ ] click on a recipe to get more information about the recipe  
- [ ] filter recipes  
- [ ] rate recipes  
- [ ] add, edit and delete own recipe  
- [ ] add recipes to own collection/cook book, and delete them again
